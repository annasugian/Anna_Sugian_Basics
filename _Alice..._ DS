over his shoulder with some curiosity about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be said alice a little timidly but it s no use going back to untwist it after a while she remembered that she still held the first she said and see whether it s marked poison or not you might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle

fire irons came first then followed a shower of saucepans what does it matter to me whether you re a little girl or a experiment wonder at the mouse s tail but why do you call it sad and suppressed by the officers of the court as that is rather a in that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i quite hungry to look at them i wish they d get the trial done again end of the table the mock

reason they re called lessons the gryphon begin alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as the hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into what would become of you into this they slipped the guinea pig head first and then sat could the next witness was the duchess s cook she carried the the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave and so she went on taking first one side and then the other tone and the gryphon added come let s hear some of your never boots every christmas voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places soon make you

used to do it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with but i m not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house well if i must i must the king said with a melancholy pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep then the words don t fit you said the king looking round dormouse and repeated her question why did they live at the waiting in a hot tureen into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight little use as it left no mark on the slate before she had this fit fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that the hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse whisper it in less than no time she d have everybody executed all round court without even waiting to put his shoes on but i don t want to go among mad people alice remarked long ringlets and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all and i m three legged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was thinking again the duchess asked with another dig of her i m sure those are not the right words said poor alice and after the birds why she ll eat a little bird as soon as look i can tell you more than that if you like said the the rabbit hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way somebody said alice whispered that it s done by everybody again very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish well i ve often seen a cat without a grin thought alice rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her earnestly the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off herself finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had wasting the court and the king put on his spectacles and looked turtle in a tone of great relief now at ours they had at the you did said the mock turtle i shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up leaving alice alone with the gryphon alice did not quite like and oh dear how puzzling it all is i ll try if i know all the flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips i know ah then yours wasn t a really good school said the mock however it may kiss my hand if it likes still running on the song i d have said to the porpoise keep rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but i m and who are these said the queen pointing to the three ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a instantly made a memorandum of the fact still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place give your evidence the king repeated angrily or i ll have i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage but then always to have lessons to learn oh i shouldn t like that presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it you politely for i can t understand it myself to begin with and boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep politely if i had it written down but i can t quite follow it cunning and they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her are you to get in at all said the footman that s the curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little pray what is the reason of that beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she they all can said the duchess and most of em do began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a him off with his whiskers trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went but what did the dormouse say one of the jury asked but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice have signed your name like an honest man and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game a song i couldn t afford to learn it said the mock turtle with a and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few mouth enough for it to speak with cut off you know so you see miss we re doing our best afore you know you say things are much of a muchness did you ever feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like found what said the duck furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live i shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow it busily painting them red alice thought this a very curious that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it i won t indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding things went on just as usual i wonder if i ve been changed in were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent she thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemed if i d been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded it s no the trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave oh i ve had such a curious dream said alice and she told you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled she waited for some time without hearing anything more at sense they d take the roof off after a minute or two they and said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful world of trouble you know as we needn t try to find any and checked herself hastily girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in hurry to change the subject allow me to sell you a couple was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was were looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat for anything tougher than suet which remained some time after the rest of it had gone the fish footman began by producing from under his arm a great nobody asked your opinion said alice never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere i never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he idiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently and came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice here one of the guinea pigs cheered and was immediately his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out alice folded her hands and began i can t take more must have a the king s argument was that anything that had a head could be its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare ought to go from here for i never was so small as this before never and i declare her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember have no answers digging her sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added at his time of life the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a alarm this time there could be no mistake about it it was seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay daresay it s a french mouse come over with william the what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do but doesn t begin but she waited patiently would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand last came a little feeble squeaking voice that s bill so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with mouse to the manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without perhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to distance executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one end of the bill french music and washing extra voice to the company generally you are all pardoned come how are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please well i ve tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it nearly carried it off only answered come on and ran the faster while more and more foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more these words were followed by a very long silence broken only this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a hearing for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having my dear said alice seriously i ll have nothing more to do in the lock and to her great delight it fitted yet you turned a back somersault in at the door no indeed said alice what sort of a dance is it of his shrill little voice the name alice height to be but here to alice s great surprise the duchess s voice died as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice wish you would have this cat removed then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it said alice a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when for your walk coming in a minute nurse but i ve got to see when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to it s the oldest rule in the book said the king everybody looked at alice very decided tone tell her something about the games now you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak speak english said the eaglet i don t know the meaning of some book but i don t remember where smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much you mean you can t take less said the hatter it s very beautiful soup so rich and green the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt can t get out at the door i do wish i hadn t drunk quite so we know it to be true fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three m such as mouse traps and the moon and memory and muchness down a large rabbit hole under the hedge bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their sounds of broken glass what a number of cucumber frames there the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes and grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees noticing her then followed the knave of hearts carrying the then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled so much about a whiting before he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil but made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in question what sort of people live about here know how to begin for you see so many out of the way things that loose slate oh it s coming down heads below a loud believe there s an atom of meaning in it once said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was as she said these words her foot slipped and in another judge i ll wondering how she was ever to get out again she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at serpent screamed the pigeon you promised to tell me your history you know said alice dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down doubt that it had a very turn up nose much more like a snout moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to the queen s croquet ground behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it back to land again and that s all the first figure said the low voice your majesty must cross examine this witness their heads are gone if it please your majesty the soldiers chapter xi unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to a mad tea party here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said can t swim can you he added turning to the knave to play croquet the white rabbit put on his spectacles where shall i begin dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the unimportant alice could see this as she was near enough to this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a behind him like that he got behind alice as he spoke i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only swim after them screamed the gryphon was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no suppose spoke it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar king said for about the twentieth time that day thatched with fur it was so large a house that she did not direction in which the march hare was said to live i ve seen so she stood still where she was and waited those serpents there s no pleasing them eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at call the next witness and he added in an undertone to the with you mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to same words as before it s all his fancy that he hasn t got she would keep through all her riper years the simple and ah that accounts for it said the hatter he won t stand i m not myself you see you might just as well say added the march hare that i at this corner no tie em together first they don t reach half addressing nobody in particular she d soon fetch it back never mind said the king with an air of great relief hear oneself speak and they don t seem to have any rules in to move she soon got it out again and put it right not that dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two month and doesn t tell what o clock it is it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the and how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly tut tut child said the duchess everything s got a find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was i never said i didn t interrupted alice you ll get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it do you think i can listen all day to such stuff over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboard whenever i eat or drink anything so i ll just see what this finished wow wow wow like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of down i am so very tired of being all alone here when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon down down down would the fall never come to an end i a alice and sighing think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin however she did not picked her way through the wood it s the stupidest tea party i wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be been doing here i haven t opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems alice looked down at them and considered a little before she room at all for any lesson books making quite a commotion in the pool as it went chapter ii last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper turning to alice she went on what s your name child are tarts made of quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old i never heard of uglification alice ventured to say what is it don t take this child away with me thought alice they re sure change lobsters and retire in same order continued the it s the first position in dancing alice said but was then bill s to go down here bill the master says you re to lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once saying and the words came very queer indeed a caucus race and a long tale simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys twinkle twinkle little bat so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book shelves all i know is it would feel very queer to me can t remember what things said the caterpillar it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question i i m a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she alice again upon it wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched our words a little from the queen an invitation for the duchess wouldn t suit the works he added looking angrily at the march look at the queen who was reading the list of singers turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic nothing alice could see as well as if she were looking over their said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of up and say who am i then tell me that first and then if i and beat him when he sneezes pleased and wag my tail when i m angry therefore i m mad cry again the mouse only growled in reply alice s adventures in wonderland her you ve no right to grow here said the dormouse they ve begun asking riddles i believe i can guess that she alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a chorus who stole the tarts with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the deepest contempt i ve seen a good many little girls in my stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with like being that person i ll come up if not i ll stay down open place with a little house in it about four feet high unimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is beau ootiful soo oop then you keep moving round i suppose said alice trickling down his face as long as it lasted to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and brown hair and it ll fetch things when you throw them and pig and pepper of his tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family the duck it s generally a frog or a worm the question is and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting chorus it s a friend of mine a cheshire cat said alice allow me thing said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what he might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all i said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldn t keep minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen prosecute guests to execution once more the pig baby was sneezing on the severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered don t talk nonsense said alice more boldly you know with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a as if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs said the did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly creatures argue it s enough to drive one crazy the queen s argument was that if something wasn t done about we had the best of educations in fact we went to school your hair wants cutting said the hatter he had been dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie as far out to sea as you can we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end involved in this affair i don t believe it said the pigeon but if they do why what a funny watch she remarked it tells the day of the them didn t know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long this pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse mouse that he case i can go back by railway she said to herself alice had it s no business of mine dance invited said the march hare the twinkling of the tea wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and curiosity and what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great croqueted the queen s hedgehog just now only it ran away when it at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among and have grown most uncommonly fat there s a porpoise close behind us and he s treading on my house had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to teacup instead of the bread and butter the night let me think was i the same when i got up this size by this time you re nothing but a pack of cards yourself come on cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand begin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on dinah at you and butter the cat slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has i haven t the least idea what you re talking about said how i wonder what you re at oh please mind what you re doing cried alice jumping up these were the verses the white rabbit read day i will tell you how the dodo managed it alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would head or off with her head those whom she sentenced were rabbit hole and yet and yet it s rather curious you know whoever lives there thought alice it ll never do to come it is well i can t show it you myself the mock turtle said i m the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and the king turned pale and shut his note book hastily cur such cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle s so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find you ought to have finished said the king when did you and went down on one knee i m a poor man your majesty he you re thinking about something my dear and that makes you this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got unwillingly took the place of the march hare the hatter was the i don t see said the caterpillar each with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphon waist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that i m so you did old fellow said the others if you didn t sign it said the king that only makes the last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect come on then roared the queen and alice joined the ventured to ask silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please her french lesson book the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i well i ll eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger hand it over here said the dodo hard word i will just explain to you how it was done they had you re a very poor speaker said the king went on to himself in an undertone important unimportant once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the a bright idea came into alice s head is that the reason so lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of be savage if i ve kept her waiting alice felt so desperate but then i shouldn t be hungry for it you know began to cry again for she felt very lonely and low spirited whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether nearly forgotten to ask on their slates and she could even make out that one of them dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me conqueror for with all her knowledge of history alice had the king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said stuff and nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having nothing whatever said alice oh she knows such a very little besides she s she and i m i would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful time that proves his guilt said the queen but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it size for going through the little door into that lovely garden yes i think you d better leave off said the gryphon and angry and wags its tail when it s pleased now i growl when i m moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly thank you said alice it s very interesting i never knew in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down executed the queen smiled and passed on i m afraid i don t know one said alice rather alarmed at forget to talk i can t tell you just now what the moral of that after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared i d rather not the cat remarked was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily again because it stays the same year for such a long time together you re growing too london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was little thing was snorting like a steam engine when she caught it and yet you incessantly stand on your head is but i shall remember it in a bit down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its that s quite enough i hope i shan t grow any more as it is i explain all that said the mock turtle trees upon her face they all moved off and alice was soon left alone get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder i say that s the same thing you know i didn t know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the yes that s it said the hatter with a sigh it s always the end see it trot away quietly into the wood if it had grown up the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on sing you may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the keeping up the conversation a little a present of everything i ve said as yet you must remember remarked the king or i ll have you when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought the milk jug into his plate everybody says come on here thought alice as she went what do you know about this business the king said to law i will falling down a very deep well things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means alice was silent would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a is one place on if everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a the dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured death i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the of breath and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the both go to at this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate fills the whole window say to itself then i ll go round and get in at the window brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the it s all about as curious as it can be said the gryphon should think dinah was the cat i hope they ll remember of mixed flavour of cherry tart custard pine apple roast it down the rabbit hole the pool of tears began again ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence in which is just the case with mine said the hatter cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing there is another shore you know upon the other side only a thimble said alice sadly story for yourself dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was very good naturedly began hunting about for them but they were i wish i hadn t cried so much said alice as she swam about i don t like the look of it at all said the king head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have exactly as we were then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance same thing as i sleep when i breathe are their heads off shouted the queen beautiful garden among the bright flower beds and the cool fountains use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished then you should say what you mean the march hare went on which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone and walking away you insult me by talking such nonsense i m a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a mock turtle beautiful beauti ful soup ambition distraction uglification and derision voice they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the does beheaded and that you weren t to talk nonsense exactly so said alice then you may sit down the king replied perhaps it doesn t understand english thought alice i sea even know what they re about alice called out as loud as she could if you do i ll set that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed he hurried off i won t said alice little scream of laughter oh hush the rabbit whispered in a was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not digging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily here alice could not stand and she went round the court and got only as it s asleep i suppose it doesn t mind there s no sort of use in knocking said the footman and there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she the dance see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the trying to invent something which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one but as the door opened inwards and alice s elbow was pressed will you won t you will you won t you won t you join the finish his story trembled so that he shook both his shoes off twinkle twinkle it goes on you know the hatter continued in this way conversation while she was trying to fix on one the cook took prizes a trial but said i could not swim she could very true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both is something comes at me like a jack in the box and up i goes don t be impertinent said the king and don t look at me anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad tail once upon a time there were three little sisters the look over their slates but it doesn t matter a bit she screaming with passion she had already heard her sentence three well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i was going on as she heard the queen s voice in the distance be full of soup was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon pulling me out of the window i only wish they could i m sure i it isn t directed at all said the white rabbit in fact against each other however they got settled down in a minute or i d rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think but everything s curious today i think i may as well go in at once he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran bottle does i do hope it ll make me grow large again for she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but please ma am is this new zealand or australia and she tried however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured when the queen jumped up and bawled out he s murdering the stand on their hands and feet to make the arches i haven t the slightest idea said the hatter sure it does yer honour but it s an arm for all that the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of crash now who did that it was bill i fancy who s to go never executes nobody you know come on behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing wasn t always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about directions will look what size do you want to be it asked put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again what for said alice would happen miss alice come here directly and get ready plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even when she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread and butter there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she then it ought to be number one said alice looking as solemn as she could you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more officers of the court and i never understood what it meant subject they can t prove i did there s no name signed at the end instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get sounded best shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the i wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloud sounds will take care of themselves alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and a little more conversation with her friend the soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to what happened to you tell us all about it the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a repeat you are old father william said the caterpillar hers would in the after time be herself a grown woman and how beat time when i learn music and alice s first thought was that it might belong to one of the reason to be afraid of it for this must ever be pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents night and be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself of course the mock turtle said advance twice set to why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it i feared it might injure the brain quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an and your hair has become very white it was so long since she had been anything near the right size here till i m somebody else but oh dear cried alice with a herald read the accusation said the king sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid what porpoise on that they d let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence at you may not have lived much under the sea i haven t said alice dance alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up splashing paint over me like that it begins i passed by his garden others looked round also and all of them bowed low you don t know much said the duchess and that s a fact like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember true no no said the queen sentence first verdict afterwards thank you it s a very interesting dance to watch said bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat pat where are impatiently any shrimp could have told you that there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice she can t explain it said the gryphon hastily go on with the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her you might catch a bat and that s very like a mouse you know the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some the treacle from different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said sitting next to her i can hardly breathe the cat only grinned when it saw alice it looked good so proud as all that and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the again before it s done think she was rather glad there was no one listening this quicker to make out exactly what they said found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william what i see and punching him in the back at last the mock turtle recovered gloves grave and anxious last remark it s a vegetable it doesn t look like one but it way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did the poor little thing sat down and cried letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to would be time well at any rate the dormouse said the hatter went on or longitude i ve got to alice had no idea what latitude was would you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are that the mouse doesn t get out only i don t think alice went little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she can t possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i seem sending presents to one s own feet and how odd the poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one again i dare say there may be one carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and interest in questions of eating and drinking conversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar s drawling stretching and fainting in coils i kept all my limbs very supple honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at it turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it had in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round which brought them back again to the beginning of the the month is it he said turning to alice he had taken his their friends had taught them such as that a red hot poker and just take his head off outside the queen added to one sharp little chin leave off that screamed the queen you make me giddy her violently with its wings to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was a most extraordinary noise going on within a constant howling consider your verdict the king said to the jury that s not a regular rule you invented it just now alice anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under give your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the things all because they would not remember the simple rules even if i fell off the top of the house which was very likely choked with sobs to sing this the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as two guinea pigs who were giving it something out of a bottle there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear consider my dear she is only a child a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to grand procession came the king and queen of hearts alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list gardeners who ran to alice for protection so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when happen any minute and then thought she what would become of a great deal to come before that her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never and concluded the banquet hold your tongue said the queen turning purple makes people hot tempered she went on very much pleased at hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but and would only say i am older than you and must know better it s getting she was close behind it when she turned the much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it won t be considering how in the world she was to get out again getting late so alice got up and ran off thinking while she what trial is it alice panted as she ran but the gryphon they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on alice was only too glad to do so lives a march hare visit either you like they re both mad over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her face and if that s all you know about it you may stand down thought to herself i don t see how he can even finish if he you did said the hatter a real turtle and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the no no the adventures first said the gryphon in an sulkily remarked if you can t be civil you d better finish the i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in but what am i to do said alice could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it little golden key and when she went back to the table for it i ve a right to think said alice sharply for she was poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or it is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it i m afraid i can t put it more clearly alice replied very by the use of this ointment one shilling the box attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the afraid that it would be offended again as well adventures little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began you ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive dear i d nearly forgotten that i ve got to grow up again let i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle well eh seen them of course while the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept lewis carroll hanging from the roof soup of the evening beautiful soup it signifies much she said to herself i should think it and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish thought it s sure to make some change in my size and as it anxiously round to make out who was talking two and the game began alice thought she had never seen such a how should i know said alice surprised at her own courage wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubled up soldiers you and then a voice she had never heard before sure then grunt said alice that s not at all a proper way of expressing high enough yet oh they ll do well enough don t be particular difficult game indeed mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves would not could not would not could not would not join well it s got no business there at any rate go and take it a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at time off with his head again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some common way they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat know and then after that into a butterfly i should think you ll down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to his first speech you shan t be beheaded said alice and she put them into a so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake you are said the king you couldn t have wanted it much said alice living at the going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying way i want to go let me see i ll give them a new pair of well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone don t be with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being come there s no use in crying like that said alice to as wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesn t and looked very uncomfortable understand why it is i hate cats and dogs alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very serpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more i m sure i m not ada she said for her hair goes in such why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the sea shore and rome no that s all wrong i m certain i must have been ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find i do alice hastily replied at least at least i mean what water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes all right so far said the king and he went on muttering raving mad at least not so mad as it was in march as she said sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking no it ll their mouths so they couldn t get them out again that s all some while in silence oh you can t help that said the cat we re all mad here this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again it s too bad that it is they were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and boy and the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose no sorrow you know come on with gently smiling jaws alice have you seen the mock turtle yet was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether exact shape doesn t matter it said and then all the party shouted in reply listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so said the so they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes alice as she could do to hold it in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do please come back and finish your story alice called after as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on meaning of it at all however jury men would have done just they would call after her the last time she saw them they were say and people began running about in all directions tumbling up her to pass away the time as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it made her so savage when they met in the kitchen her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was nothing said alice beautiful beautiful soup the gryphon would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready mabel i ll stay down here it ll be no use their putting their been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow she s in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a cheap sort of present thought alice i m glad they don t me they re dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great nonsense said alice very loudly and decidedly and the were learning to draw you know and both creatures hid their faces in their paws duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious i should like to have it explained said the mock turtle as she said this she looked down at her hands and was seem to dry me at all other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and bite and the moral of that is birds of a feather flock roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort were placed along the course here and there there was no one being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice certainly not said alice indignantly little before she made her next remark then the eleventh day you d only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the solemnly sorrowful tone at least there s no room to grow up any more as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door chapter vii remarked they d have been ill disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down it off air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till the most confusing thing i ever heard when you have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day you thoughtfully i should like to hear her try and repeat answer questions how am i to get in she repeated aloud shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave they ll arm that was linked into hers began to tremble alice looked up very cautiously but i don t understand where did they draw why not said the march hare it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why pig water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i beg she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of school in the sea the master was an old turtle we used to call the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is the hatter shook his head mournfully not i he replied here the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep tis so said the duchess and the moral of that is oh get up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the a little hot tea upon its nose asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight with some severity it s very rude of her or of anything else that s a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back have of putting things dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run bill then the rabbit s voice along catch him you by the puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing i want a clean cup interrupted the hatter let s all move oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again till you come to the end then stop nothing whatever persisted the king jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury box with above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one really now you ask me said alice very much confused i alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so added aloud was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating what a curious plan exclaimed alice she boxed the queen s ears the rabbit began alice gave a gryphon politely did you speak around her became alive the strange creatures of her little because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was door as you are secondly because they re making such a noise why she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with no said the caterpillar tone sit down both of you and don t speak a word till i ve why what are your shoes done with said the gryphon i till now mean what makes them so shiny ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides behind them a railway station however she soon made out that it would be as well to introduce some other subject of it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and not the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat messages for a rabbit i suppose dinah ll be sending me on herself as well as she could for sneezing what s in it said the queen are gone from this side of the ground so she tucked it away neighbouring pool she could hear the rattle of the teacups as think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to why said the caterpillar you said the caterpillar contemptuously who are you up lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady to breath drink something or other but the great question is what dormouse turn that dormouse out of court suppress him pinch i don t quite understand you she said as politely as she alice didn t think that proved it at all however she went on grinned a little wider come it s pleased so far thought two lines cried the mock turtle seals turtles salmon and so on hard against it that attempt proved a failure alice heard it will you won t you will you won t you will you join the to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat confused clamour of the busy farm yard while the lowing of the how neatly spread his claws she got into the court by the way the people near the door began having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried that her idea of the tale was something like this beautifully printed on it in large letters and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth at that the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour come back in a natural way alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her time but never one with such a neck as that no no you re a the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper a large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden the that is be what you would seem to be or if you d like it put and argued each case with my wife under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for when the race was over however when they had been running half yes we went to school in the sea though you mayn t believe english now i m opening out like the largest telescope that at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth turtle soup will you old fellow very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about i ll put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the name again she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the i think i should understand that better alice said very angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah to introduce it it s a mineral i think said alice tea time and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles off with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voice it to half past one as long as you liked who are you talking to said the king going up to alice and what are you thinking of catching mice you can t think and oh i wish you could see her saw mine coming i should like it very much said alice but i haven t been that s none of your business two said seven was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice and she went on would you tell me please which way i chapter i but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices i m glad i ve seen that done thought alice i ve so often is that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as another however i ve got back to my right size the next a fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weak either and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile and that s the jury box thought alice and those twelve what can all that green stuff be said alice and where bill s got the other bill fetch it here lad here put em up five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a gave her answer they re done with blacking i believe and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster first really clever thing the king had said that day thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be dance each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she and the moral of that is take care of the sense and the doubtful about the temper of your flamingo shall i try the dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at once you can really have no notion how delightful it will be i think you d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her i ll have you executed on the spot shan t said the cook half those long words and what s more i don t believe you do it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on the twinkling of the what said the king what did they live on said alice who always took a great quite absurd for her to carry it further uglify is you are a simpleton change lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him feet high alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways sang this very slowly and sadly alice looked at the jury box and saw that in her haste she that she thought i must be growing small again she got up her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess oh won t she through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to easy to take more than nothing so long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanation a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesn t believe of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes wonder is that there s any one left alive under the door so either way i ll get into the garden and i idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that there s half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she history gryphon we can do without lobsters you know which shall never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and round please your majesty he asked interrupted if you don t explain it as you go on it s by far particular at least if there are nobody attends to them and and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is oh dear this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept herself master though he was an old crab he was very much indeed said alice serpent no they re not said the white rabbit and that s the distant green leaves the little passage and then she found herself at last in the but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look she gave me a good character never said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english rather late and the queen said that s different from what i used to say when i was a child for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent thought alice well i hardly know no more thank ye i m sigh i only took the regular course the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes continued the king ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything and took them quite away wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural improve his shining tail side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get painting those roses moral if only you can find it and she squeezed herself up in my youth father william replied to his son and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in there isn t any said the march hare because he knows it teases the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to thing to be sure however everything is queer to day written to nobody which isn t usual you know hold your tongue added the gryphon before alice could speak dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it that depends a good deal on where you want to get to said by the frightened mouse splashed his way through the give your evidence said the king suddenly she came upon a little three legged table all made of grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time don t they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she learn lessons in here why there s hardly room for you and no to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as you re falling i don t know of any that do alice said very politely do you think at your age it is right then you shouldn t talk said the hatter cause her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset no please go on alice said very humbly i won t interrupt calling out in a confused way prizes prizes many tea things are put out here she asked all the time they were playing the queen never left off nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to i wish you wouldn t squeeze so said the dormouse who was i couldn t help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged come we shall have some fun now thought alice i m glad and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a again the mock turtle went on an obstacle that came between king the queen the royal children and everybody else give birthday presents like that but she did not venture to first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the oh i know exclaimed alice who had not attended to this gloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much frightened being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white too stiff and the gryphon never learnt it for he can thoroughly enjoy then they re a kind of serpent that s all i can say good many voices all talking together she made out the words we must burn the house down said the rabbit s voice and upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann the millennium fulcrum edition 3 0 it isn t said the caterpillar sneezing and howling alternately without a moment s pause the me see how is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or well i d hardly finished the first verse said the hatter of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so you out you know he was looking up into the sky all the time and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark on which seven looked up and said that s right five always what did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promise call it what you like said the cat do you play croquet to they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts the world am i ah that s the great puzzle and she began wake up alice dear said her sister why what a long when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked looking anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo it to begin with said the cat a dog s not mad you grant grumbled you shouldn t have put it in with the bread knife a little bright eyed terrier you know with oh such long curly frowning like a thunderstorm the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble nearly two miles high added the queen go down the chimney herself i wonder what they will do next if they had any waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle i m not a mile high said alice he sent them word i had not gone i mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting the fifth bend i think thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age not becoming what is the fun said alice sleep you ve had collar that dormouse the queen shrieked out behead that that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without if you ve seen them so often of course you know what they re energetic remedies consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the trying to find her way out i shall be punished for it now i subdued tone and added with a kind of sob i ve tried every neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be alice was not going to do that in a hurry no i ll look partners off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern i used and i don t keep the same size for ten minutes together the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle alice was very the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all to kill it in a day or two wouldn t it be murder to leave it see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness were saying if i or she should chance to be come my head s free at last said alice in a tone of some of the jury wrote it down important and some before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little the court arm in arm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are duchess s knee while plates and dishes crashed around it once sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to angrily curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much first it marked out a race course in a sort of circle the with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a speak first why your cat grins like that well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it pray how did you manage to do it and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldn t be so well what are you said the pigeon i can see you re however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the gryphon do you know why it s called a whiting queerest thing about it the jury all looked puzzled if she should push the matter on said the march hare alice was thoroughly puzzled does the boots and shoes she away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under of the sort politely but she added to herself why they re only a pack of of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious who would not give all else for two cards after all i needn t be afraid of them call the first witness said the king and the white rabbit some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they pepper box in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before soo oop of the e e evening old fury a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t ten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the few minutes and began talking to herself as usual come round on its axis not quite right i m afraid said alice timidly some of the less there is of yours all soup does very well without maybe it s always pepper that why should it muttered the hatter does your watch tell i thought you did said the mouse i proceed edwin and going on between the executioner the king and the queen who easily offended writing in his note book cackled out silence and read out witness he must have imitated somebody else s hand said the king be off or i ll kick you down stairs like a sky rocket three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate thing a lobster quadrille is certain it must be really offended we won t talk about her any replied rather shyly i i hardly know sir just at present in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more of course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short i had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrily will you won t you will you won t you won t you join the better now but i m a deal too flustered to tell you all i know really i m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking an arm you goose who ever saw one that size why it decidedly and there was silence for some minutes said the gryphon half to itself half to alice alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and back to the little door but alas the little door was shut i beat him when he sneezes very much if if i d only been the right size to do it oh the table was a large one but the three were all crowded he said do and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and roses off with their heads and the procession moved on heads she felt very curious to know what it was all about and unimportant important as if he were trying which word alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer they are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the many lessons to learn no i ve made up my mind about it if i m it was the best butter the march hare meekly replied inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was bats eat cats for you see as she couldn t answer either writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no on but why did they live at the bottom of a well alice went timidly up to the door and knocked the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might away she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face don t want to stay in here any longer nor i said the march hare shore i never thought about it said alice why people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i you what year it is ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself the knave of hearts he stole those tarts do you take me for a dunce go on see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and on without attending to her if we had the door between us for she knew the name of nearly everything there that s the adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the reeds the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep the proposal itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently time as it didn t sound at all the right word but i shall just then her head struck against the roof of the hall in at it that for two reasons first because i m on the same side of the and why it is you hate c and d she added in a whisper half let us so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming trying so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all can t have anything to put down yet before the trial s begun pennyworth only of beautiful soup ever was good bye feet for when she looked down at her with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks there s no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came but they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed own children foot are you content now said the caterpillar that i can t remember said the hatter messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that ever was at in all my life doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or as he could go come let s try the first figure said the mock turtle to the and then turning to the rose tree she went on what have you i call it purring not growling said alice choosing to notice this last remark their faces there was a sound of many footsteps and alice over its head very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look and mentioned me to him and that in about half no time take your choice on every golden scale the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on to them she heard one of them say look out now five don t go up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery replied in a pleased tone voice would you like cats if you were me hadn t quite finished my tea when i was sent for a cat may look at a king said alice i ve read that in not i said the lory hastily into alice s and they walked off together morning i ve think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in soldiers did after these came the royal children there were alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door stupid again and said so you think you re changed do you and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it poor little thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried beginning to feel a little worried hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and explain yourself remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day i don t think they play at all fairly alice began in rather alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had not a bit said the caterpillar oh you re sure to do that said the cat if you only walk creatures alice led the way and the whole party swam to the another minute there was not even room for this and she tried up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep her head about once in a minute alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i and down in an agony of terror oh there goes his precious beginning to see its meaning stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said remembering her own child life and the happy summer days went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great getting home the night air doesn t suit my throat and a canary tails in their mouths and they re all over crumbs large flower pot that stood near the three soldiers wandered solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of no i didn t said alice i don t think it s at all a pity said the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and her saucer of milk at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were it all came different the mock turtle repeated advice from a caterpillar i didn t mean it pleaded poor alice but you re so easily as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her of course you don t the hatter said tossing his head can t see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate anything you like said the footman and began whistling the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing or so and what with the bread and butter getting so thin and she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply call the next witness said the king the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess i don t know said the caterpillar by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely soo oop of the e e evening sure it s an arm yer honour he pronounced it arrum the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great go on for some time without interrupting it it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write but tea i don t see any wine she remarked eyes but it said nothing more to come so she sat still and said nothing that would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully some of the other birds tittered audibly tell us a story said the march hare i ll tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice s shoulder he turn them out with his nose you know at any rate i ll never go there again said alice as she he denies it said the king leave out that part then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round ugh said the lory with a shiver i deny it said the march hare game or any other dish her here and the executioner went off like an arrow that s right shouted the queen can you play croquet i grow up i ll write one but i m grown up now she added in a over the verses to himself we know it to be true that s all know whether it would like the name however it only that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook well it must be removed said the king very decidedly and thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon again and we won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the alice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in why there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to contemptuously i dare say you never even spoke to time i m here digging for apples yer honour the lobsters to the dance so they got thrown out to sea so then it doesn t matter which way you go said the cat tis love tis love that makes the world go round minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as i ll be opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to you ll see me there said the cat and vanished head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had and when she had tired herself out with trying with extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously here and the moral of that is the more there is of mine the and crossed over to the other side of the court she first saw the white rabbit she was a little nervous about just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a i beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to oh you sing said the gryphon i ve forgotten the words dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head i dare say you re wondering why i don t put my arm round your them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes anxious to have the experiment tried solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her chorus again cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had chapter viii yawning i m getting tired of this i vote the young lady natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great more to be said please then said alice how am i to get in back to the croquet ground been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late making faces at him as he spoke making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said subject of conversation are you are you fond of of dogs her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel glass there was no label this time with the words drink me alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped beating now if you only kept on good terms with him he d do as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be when the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright i passed by his garden and marked with one eye first question you know shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things but it makes rather a handsome pig i think and she began mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures how surprised he ll be when he finds out who i am but i d see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which just been picked up beau ootiful soo oop dear dear how queer everything is to day and yesterday what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly up above the world you fly as you say it people knew that then they wouldn t be so stingy about it you voice are done with a whiting now you know moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first thought alice without pictures or conversation no jury with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first we called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock up his head brandy now don t choke him how was it old fellow know and he says it s so useful it s worth a hundred pounds are the jurors she said this last word two or three times over who for such dainties would not stoop it proves nothing of the sort said alice why you don t did you say pig or fig said the cat there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable would not could not would not could not could not join what it might appear to others that what you were or might have the jury of course i gave her one they gave him two why the room the cook threw a frying pan after her as she went out have been a red rose tree and we put a white one in by mistake but it just missed her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under i ve none of my own i m a hatter bank the birds with draggled feathers the animals with their you come i don t know what you mean said alice how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the alice considered a little and then said the fourth please your majesty said the knave i didn t write it and silence who is it directed to said one of the jurymen rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of different but if i m not the same the next question is who in a knot said alice always ready to make herself useful and said on and off for days and days one indeed said the dormouse indignantly however he you can draw water out of a water well said the hatter so the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently undoing itself she carried it out into the open air if i it does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the but now that i m perfectly sure i have none passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when oh don t talk about trouble said the duchess i make you there s an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her not at all said alice she s so extremely just then yes shouted alice alice s evidence what would be the use of a procession thought she if people to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a i ve been to a day school too said alice you needn t be very said alice where s the duchess to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody sure i can t be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she king s crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this writing desks which wasn t much watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking march hare moved into the dormouse s place and alice rather thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had i believe so alice replied thoughtfully they have their the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in thought to herself for they haven t got much evidence yet she said to herself young crab a little snappishly you re enough to try the turn them over broken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself later editions continued as follows take some more tea the march hare said to alice very quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself i can t go no lower said the hatter i m on the floor as it were nine o clock in the morning just time to begin lessons all on a summer day down the chimney nay i shan t you do it that i won t who are you said the caterpillar the game s going on rather better now she said by way of alice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatter s remark seemed to a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went have to ask them what the name of the country is you know heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only look come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good try the i ve heard something like it said alice them however on the second time round she came upon a low why she said the gryphon it s all her fancy that they to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in the knave did so very carefully with one foot morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and such things that make children sweet tempered i only wish you d better not do that again which produced another dead came skimming out straight at the footman s head it just i don t much care where said alice just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which only one doesn t like changing so often you know its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a may it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone remarked because they lessen from day to day don t be all day about it and he went on in these words are they in the prisoner s handwriting asked another of long enough think very likely it can talk at any rate there s no harm in who s making personal remarks now the hatter asked you know the song perhaps the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight no there were no tears if you re going to turn into a pig first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was better take him his fan and gloves that is if i can find them shall get on better but about his toes the mock turtle persisted how could hopeful tone though i won t have any pepper in my kitchen at running out of the wood she considered him to be a footman with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the in which the cook and the baby joined heavy sobs distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her but when the tide rises and sharks are around alice to herself shy they seem to put everything upon bill out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it the jurymen and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the that s about the right distance but then i wonder what latitude yes said alice doubtfully it means to make anything prettier dears it s high time you were all in bed on various pretexts was the best butter you know and asking but who has won get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of are i m never sure what i m going to be from one minute to morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside invited yet alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice dance come that finished the guinea pigs thought alice now we before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as it triumphantly what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up two days wrong sighed the hatter i told you butter i think that will be the best plan the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going when i used to read fairy tales i fancied that kind of thing the pepper when he pleases more simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than yes please do pleaded alice little glass table now i ll manage better this time write that down the king said to the jury and the jury twinkled after that only the march hare said her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck her head made her look up in a great hurry how am i to get in asked alice again in a louder tone stupid things alice began in a loud indignant voice but am now that ll be a comfort one way never to be an old woman you executed whether you re nervous or not of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree chapter x that you won t thought alice and after waiting till she for instance there s the arch i ve got to go through next back please we don t want you with us you should learn not to make personal remarks alice said called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin like a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a execution speech they all cheered took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was never happened and now here i am in the middle of one there the court with a smile there was a dead silence barrowful will do to begin with you must be said the cat or you wouldn t have come here hush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone he began no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she chapter v not so she went in search of her hedgehog afraid of interrupting him i ll give him sixpence _i_ don t yawned and shut his eyes tell her about the reason and all they had to pinch it to make it stop more if you d rather not the next verse an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the to me and told me he was going a journey i should say with she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so uncomfortable the further off from england the nearer is to france this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that trial it quite makes my forehead ache child was very fond of pretending to be two people but it s no fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard lay the blame on others it s it s a very fine day said a timid voice at her side there s more evidence to come yet please your majesty said turtle angrily really you are very dull here the other guinea pig cheered and was suppressed little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear i ve tried the roots of trees and i ve tried banks and i ve the back however it was over at last and they sat down again why did you call him tortoise if he wasn t one alice asked and how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in a you d better not talk said five i heard the queen say only the jury all brightened up again handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write but then thought alice shall i never get any older than i i ll fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and that s very important the king said turning to the jury hatter who turned pale and fidgeted something now tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon as what was that like said alice the queen of hearts she made some tarts the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then don t care which happens and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded who cares for you said alice she had grown to her full i see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so that he said to the gryphon the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work the first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup in reeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his i m not a serpent said alice indignantly let me alone you advance twice from his book rule forty two all persons more than a mile it must have been that said the king unless it was you re wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an beautiful beautiful soup looking at the cat s head with great curiosity taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back all this time the queen had never left off staring at the oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind denial we far off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on for she had read several nice little histories about children who chapter xii king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of so they were said the dormouse very ill a very unpleasant state of mind she turned away cold if she did not get dry very soon added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence what a pity it wouldn t stay sighed the lory as soon as it ever having seen such a thing appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddy great many more than three bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of i said what for nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your hours i think or is it twelve i i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning i ll and washing said the mock turtle repeating his remark with variations i shall sit here he other arm curled round her head still she went on growing and but a grin without a cat it s the most curious thing i ever oh as to the whiting said the mock turtle they you ve i have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very all right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly dear sir the sentence first alice and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a said the lory beautiful soup who cares for fish that s enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting duchess you d better ask her about it be a grin and she said to herself it s the cheshire cat now i as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trial s beginning he only does it to annoy branch of a tree adding you re looking for eggs i know that well enough and such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it askance clock in a twinkling half past one time for dinner and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and know your history she do it s a pun the king added in an offended tone and right as usual said the duchess what a clear way you the rabbit sends in a little bill condemn ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when said alice alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather through the earth how funny it ll seem to come out among the this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its yes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her has lasted the rest of my life seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over pepper mostly said the cook like having a game of play with a cart horse and expecting every the other guests had taken advantage of the queen s absence with seaography then drawling the drawling master was an old gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as was for bringing the cook tulip roots instead of onions i can t explain myself i m afraid sir said alice because what are they doing alice whispered to the gryphon they must be thought alice i wonder what they ll do next as for and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for violent shake at the end of every line for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and where it had been it suddenly appeared again sneezing all at once suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost wish i d consented to go on and so these three little sisters they i m a poor man the hatter went on and most things officer could get to the door explain the paper he won t do a thing i ask it s always six o clock now and be quick about it added the hatter or you ll be asleep to queer things happening while she was looking at the place this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a how cheerfully he seems to grin what is a caucus race said alice not that she wanted much here bill catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that wow wow wow take off your hat the king said to the hatter her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth his voice has a timid and tremulous sound and welcome little fishes in oh so bill s got to come down the chimney has he said crumbs would all wash off in the sea but they have their tails changed for mabel i ll try and say how doth the little when i m a duchess she said to herself not in a very herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute he said was why is a raven like a writing desk that must be what he did with the tarts you know they all returned from him to you alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so finishing the game soo oop of the e e evening how doth the little crocodile hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be how fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to seen in her brother s latin grammar a mouse of a mouse to a singers in the last concert on which the wretched hatter chapter ix mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice heard of uglifying it exclaimed you know what to beautify is trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the serpent and there s no use denying it i suppose you ll be there was certainly too much of it in the air even the what made you so awfully clever decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for no more of it appeared suppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the large eyes full of tears but said nothing all but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked the shore and then i ll tell you my history and you ll offended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing her find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally way and nothing seems to suit them really this himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and if there s no meaning in it said the king that saves a wouldn t it really said alice in a tone of great surprise conger eel that used to come once a week he taught us wouldn t talk about wasting it it s him effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable the players all played at once without waiting for turns i ll take no house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this i m mad you re mad you gave us three or more not in that ridiculous fashion and he got up very sulkily remark myself the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and here cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea it s on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing looked round eager to see the queen like that curious song about the whiting or judge she is such a nice soft thing to nurse and she s such a capital all think me at home why i wouldn t say anything about it were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking oh dear what nonsense i m talking question it didn t much matter which way she put it she felt looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw settled down again into its nest alice crouched down among the tells us a story trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled chapter iv the executioner s argument was that you couldn t cut off a i m very sorry you ve been annoyed said alice who was thick wood far below her a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in i didn t know it was your table said alice it s laid for a later again the cook had disappeared it began with the tea the hatter replied be jury why with an m said alice out the fish footman was gone and the other was sitting on the and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a queen was silent one hand and a piece of bread and butter in the other i beg rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large well perhaps you haven t found it so yet said alice but exactly as if nothing had happened and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood continued i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah she said to herself in a into a tree she would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw voice mouth and its great eyes half shut serpents do you know hearthrug the panther took pie crust and gravy and meat and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question gryphon went on or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two yesterday because i was a different person then didn t know that cats could grin i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let to learn its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no he trusts to you to set them free and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she went not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldn t marched off after the others oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied see the mock turtle and to hear his history i must go back and down here with me there are no mice in the air i m afraid but one for catching mice oh i beg your pardon cried alice again my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of after that continued the hatter i cut some more bread hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of the great question certainly was what alice looked all round all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the not at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep know the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown let s go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice here idea came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she minute or two doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came he s perfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went in through the air do you think you could manage it and what next and so on you can t think how glad i am to see you again you dear old what was that inquired alice day why i haven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled what fun hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it your shoes and stockings for you now dears i m sure _i_ shan t knowledge just think of what work it would make with the day as he spoke and added it isn t a letter after all it s a set and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so high to leave the court melancholy tone nobody seems to like her down here and i m you are old father william the young man said it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said met in the him tortoise way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to say it out loud oh don t bother me said the duchess i never could abide were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few began talking again dinah ll miss me very much to night i was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very why i do it again and again it must be a very pretty dance said alice timidly well then the cat went on you see a dog growls when it s they were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle one side of what the other side of what thought alice to said his father don t give yourself airs gazing up into the roof of the court out when they saw alice coming there s plenty of room said it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected i beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going patience of an oyster had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a but it doesn t matter much thought alice as all the arches oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers she ll get me it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the sour and camomile that makes them bitter and and barley sugar never had to do such a thing before and he wasn t going to begin twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that i never saw one or heard of one said alice alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm chair at one the march hare and his friends shared their never ending meal of which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit presently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to every day she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldn t see it he says it kills all the rats and oh dear cried alice in a talking of axes said the duchess chop off her head by the bye what became of the baby said the cat i d bells and the queen s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd exactly so said the hatter as the things get used up way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat multiplication table doesn t signify let s try geography great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing of the officers but the hatter was out of sight before the that s nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as how do you know i m mad said alice result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare taught laughing and grief they used to say after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the the week before treacle said the dormouse without considering at all this all would change to dull reality the grass would be only he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear i procession wondering very much what would happen next going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should be you got in your pocket he went on turning to alice and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again or kettle had been broken to pieces sure she s the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah i said the king rubbing his hands so now let the jury trial for fell past it and ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb trembling voice and i hadn t begun my tea not above a week howled so that alice could hardly hear the words in another moment down went alice after it never once bottom of the sea the caterpillar was the first to speak it advisable the dance now i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped whole alice did not much like keeping so close to her first and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and door leading right into it that s very curious she thought it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her person they had to fall a long way so they got their tails fast in of course twinkling begins with a t said the king sharply found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the moderate but the insolence of his normans how are you dance all the other queer noises would change she knew to the perhaps he can t help it she said to herself his eyes are so much do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise what never you are old said the youth as i mentioned before surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good them called out sit down all of you and listen to me i ll then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with they re putting down their names the gryphon whispered in alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse by mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadn t gone down that field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop of them with the other the only difficulty was that her kind to them thought alice or perhaps they won t walk the shall have somebody to talk to full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was i m afraid i am sir said alice i can t remember things as the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit don t think things indeed were really impossible two three and away but they began running when they liked words have got altered the hatter was the first to break the silence what day of because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only and how do you know that you re mad moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she again she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed come and help me out of this sounds of more broken glass that s very curious like a telescope how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked my elbow looking across the garden called out the queen the queen please would you tell me said alice a little timidly for it wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant oh there s no use in talking to him said alice desperately directions just like a star fish thought alice the poor it s the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queen i keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation then said it was a treacle well question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and i suppose out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy to them to be otherwise white kid gloves while she was talking how can i have done the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as fury said to a we quarrelled last march just before he went mad you know yet i don t know he went on spreading out the verses on his closer to alice s side as she spoke would break she pitied him deeply what is his sorrow she yes it is his business said five and i ll tell him it so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a important to say alice s right foot esq was heard in the distance very nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he might to everything that alice said there s a large mustard mine near while the panther received knife and fork with a growl good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset must have been a holiday seemed not to be listening so she went on again twenty four where s the other ladder why i hadn t to bring but one me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for so he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened only mustard isn t a bird alice remarked footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping sorrowful tone i m afraid i ve offended it again for the leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself if you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you in a little while however she again heard a little pattering
